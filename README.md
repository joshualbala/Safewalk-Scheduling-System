## Safewalk Scheduling System

## Project Description:

The Safewalk Scheduling System aims to streamline the process of managing shift changes and availability for Safewalk staff. The current process relies heavily on email exchanges and manual updates, causing inefficiencies, inbox clutter, and additional workload for supervisors. This platform seeks to reduce the number of emails required and simplify the scheduling process for Safewalk staff.

## General User Experience:

Allows all Safewalk staff to mark their weekly availability, sub-out shifts, and sub-in for available shifts.
Features include a grid-style availability page where users can highlight operational hours they are available to work and easily update their status. Users will only receive notifications about available shifts matching their indicated availability.
The Sub-in and Sub-out pages simplify managing shifts by presenting current shifts in an interactive calendar format. 

## Key Features:

- Availability Page: A user-friendly interface for marking availability in an 8x4 grid format. The system defaults to assume all-time availability unless specified by the user.
- Sub-In and Sub-Out Pages: Interactive calendar-style interfaces for managing shifts with real-time data on available openings and assigned shifts.
- Email Notification System: Sends emails to only those staff members who match the availability for a given sub-out request.

## Goals:

- Minimize the number of emails sent to staff.
- Reduce workload on supervisors by automating parts of the scheduling process.
- Provide a centralized platform for Safewalk staff to manage availability and shifts efficiently.

4. Tech stack
Just don’t add every library you used. I think it’s fine to add a library if you believe that it conveys your skillset as a developer.

5. Steps on how to get your project up and running on someone else’s machine
Write out a step-by-step guide on how I could run your project on my computer.

6. Images & GIFs presenting your project demo
Images and GIFs are a great way to visually showcase your project right from the repository, especially if it’s to highlight specific features. Find & download a GIF generator and showcase some of your project’s special features.

7. Most difficult aspect of the project
Write a short paragraph on what you felt was the most difficult aspect of this project, and how you were able to overcome it.

The goal of your README.md file is to showcase your projects and your abilities as a developer in the shortest amount of time. I encourage you to be creative with images, GIFs, and your copy to achieve this goal.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
